##Predicting the functional status of water wells in Tanzania

Analysis and model by Matt Carr, Dann Morr, and Amanda Potter

#Background
Tanzania, as a developing country, struggles with providing clean water to its population of over 57,000,000. There are many waterpoints already established in the country, but some are in need of repair while others have failed altogether.  Understanding which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.

#Goal
This project seeks to develop a model to classify the functional status of water wells in Tanzania, using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water.  This analysis is being prepared for the Tanzanian Ministry of Water to aid in improving maintenance operations by lessening the number of fully functional waterpoints that are to be inspected for repairs and limiting those inspections to the waterpoints that have a high liklihood of being in need of repair or having failed altogether.  

#Questions for exploration 
- Are there areas/regions that have more failing wells?
- Does water quality appear to contribute to the likelihood of a well failing/needing repair?
- How is the status of a well associated with the population using the well, if at all?
- Is there a difference in rates of failure/repair between groundwater and surface water wells?
- is there a difference in failure/repair with the type of pump?
- Does the age of the well indicate liklihood of needed repair or failure?


Functional status of a water well will fall into one of 3 categories: 
- Functional 
- Functional, in need of repair
- Nonfunctional/failed
